Internship Work: Data Analysis and Automation Using Python
This repository contains code snippets, data visualization, and analysis techniques used during my internship. Due to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), the actual datasets used for visualization cannot be shared, but the code itself is error-free and can be adapted for future projects.

Additionally, this repository includes a presentation summarizing the various tasks completed during the six-month internship at Bosch (Sensor Processing and Development Technology Group). The presentation provides an overview of the work done and key learnings from the experience.
